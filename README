SimpleGit Ruby Library
======================

This library calls git commands and returns the output.

TJM - following along with Scott's excellent read Git Internals Peepcode (peepcode-git.pdf)
TJM - another change to test git commit without -m

TJM to put Scott's repository into my GitHub
1. I created peepcode-simple --> https://github.com/timmac62/peepcode-simple.git
2. g remote rename origin upstream
3. g remote add origin https://github.com/timmac62/peepcode-simple.git
4. g push origin master
